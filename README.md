This project applies  Jason Brownlee's  super "Your First Machine Learning Project in R Step-By-Step"  (https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-r-step-by-step/ ) to the real world data of an Italian ice store we once owned in NYC.  In particular we will investigate the relationship between Date &  Weather and Sales.
